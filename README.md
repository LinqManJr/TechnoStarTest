# TechnoStarTest
This test project is mini-book library, which contains 3 tables (Authors, Books, Country). Working with sqlite database through Dapper ORM.
On main page of the project we have table view of books with some actions like delete book or update some fields. As additional options we have ordering table by some properties.
To work with db, we must handle create sqlite database and create with seeding data with sql scripts in sql_scripts folder. After that, change database path in appsettings.json in ConnectionsStrings sections testdb property.
Good luck.
